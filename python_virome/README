Python scripts were used to extract NCC subject samples harmonise for virome and RNASeq, as well as before and after Enterovirus samples match for RNASeq. 
Python 2.7, with numpy and scipy dependencies are applied, while these scripts are provided - 
NCC IA data inputs and sample mappings are excluded as part of our data agreement and needs to be directly requested from TEDDY Data Coordinating Center (DCC)

Please reference MP183 external analysis study, PI Matti Nykter, as part of the communication with TEDDY DCC. Once TEDDY DCC have approved your request, 
contact matti.nykter@tuni.fi and inquired on the specifics inputs. TEDDY DCC performs masking on subject info, but they can also unmask and cross match on 
different MPs.
